# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Uno No Mercy

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Making the Uno No Mercy game. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
Our software will run the game with all it's wacky rules. Its features will share the same as the base game. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
Clarence Estriplet, tuq70678@temple.edu, Parsa Esmaeilkhani

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
The game barely runs. But the code is finshed and can still fuction  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game runs partially. I tink we can finsh the whole and the game runs fine.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game runs smoothly with no bugs. Hope to accomplish the code and the game running smoothly with no bugs.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For research we would fist get inspration from reguclar uno coding. Then we would find the rules and reglations of Uno no mercy, then inplament them into the Uno code. After accomplishing this we would need to remove and add
certain code for the game to run properly as they are not the same and do not have the same rules. With the way we will do our project both people will work on the same code that way less bugs and problems happen.
